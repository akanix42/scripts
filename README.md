# Ashley's personal scripts

This is a collection of my helper scripts.

### kc / switch-kubeconfig
`switch-kubeconfig` outputs the export to easily switch between different
kubernetes config files.

`kc` is a bash function that `eval`s the output of `switch-kubeconfig`.
`switch-kubeconfig` is written in Python as part of my goal of switching to Python
as my default scripting language.
